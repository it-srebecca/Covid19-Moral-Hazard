# Covid19-Moral-Hazard
Trigger warning: Covid-19-related data analysis ahead. If you're sick to death of looking at these figures, please avoid this repository.
## Introduction
The short report contained in this repository is an exploration of Covid-19 data. Using a rudimentary comparison of the UK and the UAE, I have light-heartedly explored the possibility for evidence of moral hazard in the dataset. 

Naturally, such a thing is, in reality, incredibly difficult to un-pick from the data. Nonetheless, I found it quite fun to speculate on the topic.

### Data
The data that I used for this report can be found (here)[https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data].
